![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-26-at-15.09.35.png)

## 09:00 \[team only\] Documentation, site, handover document, ... 

Make sure you have everything in your team folder, described in the handover document. 

How to deliver like a pro \[[tutorial](../../how-to-deliver-like-a-pro/)\]!

## 11:00 \[coaches only\] Coach retro

We would love to hear your feedback. If you really can't make it, we'll send the questions afterwards.

We meet via Zoom – as Discord cannot support sufficient people and some coaches cannot join Jitsi.

Meeting ID and Password will be shared in advance.
