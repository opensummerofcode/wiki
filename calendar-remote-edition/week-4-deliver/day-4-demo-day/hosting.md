# Hosting

## Get Ready as a Team & Divide work

During the breakout sessions, the whole team is present in the breakout room to welcome visitors, show off their work and answer questions \(just like in a live edition where they'd come to your booth!\).

This is a chance for you to present yourself to future employers, meet like-minded people and to show people what you've made.

{% hint style="info" %}
During the first breakout room test it was clear this job can get quite heavy; so you can definitely split up tasks over your team members and coach\(es\)!

## Pick a Noise & Troll Moderator

Make sure one person in your team is in the breakout room _first_ to become the moderator. This will give you the opportunity to turn off people's mics, hide them or kick them.

_Tip: You can already go there when the streaming event starts, so you have the chance to chase out the trolls._

### **Keep Down the Noise**

If everybody starts talking at the same time, _you're gonna have a bad time_. Only the person speaking should have their microphone on, on their turn. Your team members can manage their own microphone.

#### Start Off Quiet

You can make sure everyone starts out muted in the settings menu option to prevent starting off noisy.

#### Manage people's noise

If someone forgets to mute themselves after they've just spoken, you can mute them by clicking the three dots bottom left of their name.  
  
However, if one person is speaking, and several other people are noisy, you can mute everyone else but this person.

If you're speaking and people are noisy, you can mute everyone 😇

### Don't Feed the Trolls. Kick them.

But make sure you're not a troll yourself by using this power foolishly!

## Pick a Master of Ceremony to Welcome People

Make sure people feel welcome in your temporary home!

* Welcome everyone!
* Ask visitors to add a name
* Motivate visitors to ask questions in the chat
  * Ask visitors to come on screen with the team and turn on their mic while answering the question.
* Add suggestions, invite team members to show a demo, share websites, ...

### **Make sure people make themselves recognisable**

Urge people to enter a name, so we know who to address. This makes it easier to interact with each other.

### How to adapt your name

## Pick a Question Moderator

The Master of Ceremony might need some backup while answering questions, if there's a lot of people in there.

### Keep an eye on questions

Someone in the team can help pick interesting questions and bundle similar questions if needed. Use discord or the private message function 

How would you approach role division in a break out? How many members of your teams should remain in the break out room? Can it all be done by one person? Like pitching, MC'ing and moderating \(muting people, seeing which relevant questions there are\), showing demo tools answering questions? Seems like a lot to handle
