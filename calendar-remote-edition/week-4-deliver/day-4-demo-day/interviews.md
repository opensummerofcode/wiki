# Interviews

### What?

{% hint style="info" %}
We give short interviews to give people some insight on what went down during open summer of code, and what the atmosphere is like.

On the other hand, it gives them some time to process the amazing pitches they just saw!
{% endhint %}

### What will happen?

We show 3 pitches, then we have an interview with a 3 team representatives for each of those teams! [Sequence found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing).

### What does the team have to do?

1. Decide who is going to be the team representative that will answer that question?
2. Test that person's mic and surroundings \(we need good sound, and not too much background noise!\)

{% hint style="info" %}
As an interviewee:  
  
**Reduce noise** 😅  
Make sure you're in a space with little background noise or echo \(sitting in a closet or broom closet sometimes helps   
  
**Reduce distraction** 💃  
Create an environment that focuses on you: sit yourself in a space with a _"clean"_  background behind you. Just make sure it isn't distracting.  
  
**Light your face 🙍🏽‍♀️🔦☀️**  
Make sure we can see your face well. Light your face; not your back – always face windows & lights.  
  
**Look at us** 👀  
Look in the camera, so it feels like you're looking at us   
  
**Use a good mic 🎙**  
Use a good microphone, that is preferably not your laptop's microphone.  
- option A: Connect your phone as a mic, and keep it close to you; as if you're talking to someone on videochat. Try out different positions to avoid "pops" in your voice.  
- option B: use the microphone of your earbuds or headphones. Try all of them! It'll work better than your laptop's mic, as it is closer to your mouth.

**Energy! ⚡️**  
_****_Breathe in.. stretch.. take up space... smile. Bring your best energy.

_**Please test this with your teammates in advance!**_

### What does the team representative do?

Hurrah, you're selected as the team representative!

* Look at the [project description](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing) sheet to see what question you have to answer
  * Fill out your **name**
  * **Prepare your question**, make sure it's short & sweet ♥️
* We show 3 pitches from 3 teams, and then we take a moment to hear the answers from the representatives of those 3 teams.
  * When your team's pitch is about to go up, go to the **Waiting room in discord**. The other 2 \(or 3 in the last round\) representatives will be waiting there too. _Turn off your notifications._
  * When it's time to answer your question, you'll get introduced to the **Pitch Arena**. I'll say hi, bring you on the screen – excited to hear your answer 😊**.**  _Make sure you mute the YouTube stream so we don't get feedback!_
* **Leave when the 3 team representatives have answered** the question 😘.

_Example:_

1. _Pitches of Team 1 \(Bridges\), 2 \(ArTIFFact Control\) and 3 \(Simplification of election procedures\) are shown_
2. _Representatives of Team 1, 2 and 3 go to the waiting room during those pitches._
3. _Representatives of Team 1, 2 and 3 are introduced to the pitch area, and answer the question in that sequence._
4. _**They all leave at once when the answers have been given**._
5. _Next team pitches: 4, 5 and 6. During those pitches their representatives go to the waiting toom._
