**PITCH TIPS**  
  
**Reduce noise** 😅  
Make sure you're in a space with little background noise or echo \(sitting in a closet or broom closet sometimes helps   
  
**Reduce distraction** 💃  
Create an environment that focuses on you: sit yourself in a space with a _"clean"_  background behind you. Just make sure it isn't distracting.  
  
**Light your face 🙍🏽‍♀️🔦☀️**  
Make sure we can see your face well. Light your face; not your back – always face windows & lights.  
  
**Look at us** 👀  
Look in the camera, so it feels like you're looking at us   
  
**Use a good mic 🎙**  
Use a good microphone, that is preferably not your laptop's microphone.  
- option A: Connect your phone as a mic, and keep it close to you; as if you're talking to someone on videochat. Try out different positions to avoid "pops" in your voice.  
- option B: use the microphone of your earbuds or headphones. Try all of them! It'll work better than your laptop's mic, as it is closer to your mouth.  
  
**Position yourself like a pro 🏆**  
Use the golden ratio to position yourself in front of the camera
