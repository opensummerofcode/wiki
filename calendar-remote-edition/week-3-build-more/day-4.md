## Prepare for the Pitching Rehearsal: Instructions

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-22-at-22.11.22.png)

### During the pitches, when your team _is not_ up

We show 3 pitches, and then interview 3 teams.  
Sit back and enjoy 🤩! Show ♥️ and give feedback in \#pitch-chat.

### During the pitches, when your team _is_ up

1. We'll show 3 pitches of 3 teams \([sequence found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing)\)
2. After those 3 pitches we'll **ask one team member** of each team we just saw **to answer one question**.
3. The three representatives of those teams go to the waiting room when their pitch is up.
4. They'll be introduced to the pitch arena, where they answer the question.
5. Leave when the 3 team representatives have answered the question 😘.

#### How to prepare:

* Select **one team member** of your team.
* That team member **prepares a** _**very short**_ **answer to that question**.
* **Write down** the team member and answer here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O\_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing)

_Example:_

* _Pitches of Team 1 \(Bridges\), 2 \(ArTIFFact Control\) and 3 \(Simplification of election procedures\) are shown_
* _Representatives of Team 1, 2 and 3 go to the waiting room during those pitches._
* _Representatives of Team 1, 2 and 3 are introduced to the pitch area, and answer the question in that sequence._
* _They all leave at once when the answers have been given._
* _Next team pitches: 4, 5 and 6. During those pitches their representatives go to the waiting toom._

### After the Pitches: Project Breakouts

After the pitches, you get the opportunity to discover more and perhaps view demos 😻.

The selected teams show demos or give more information, other teams can roam & discover! Recommended when roaming: switch every 5 minutes 😉

#### Select a Host

Your job is to make things go _smoooooth_. [Write down who will](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing).

1. **Go to the breakout room first** to get moderator rights. _Keep it open in your browser tab from the moment the pitch stream starts_ 😁 __
2. **Mute** visitors _Only people that are presenting or ask questions should have their mics on._
3. Ask visitors to **write down** questions.
4. **Read those questions out loud & invite the writer to speak** whenever their question gets addressed, so they can have a conversation.
5. Something wrong? Have someone **report** to Miet in \#practical-questions. 
6. _If you have no visitors, think of a game you can play 😁 👯‍👯_
