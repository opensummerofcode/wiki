# Where to Pitch

## Where to pitch: on discord

We will live stream the pitches again; live from Discord.

### 1. Pick your pitcher

Pick who will pitch first for your team! Let us know who it will be here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O\_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LEOFnsOYX1sOJuNBzhD277bCgdci9O_vAOphsx2vnGE/edit?usp=sharing)

Don't worry, everybody gets to pitch...

### 2. Prep your pitch

If you need any help, ask your colleagues on Discord in the \#pitch channel in the category help.

### 3. At 15:30 the first pitcher goes to the voice channel _Waiting Room_, and the others follow

This will be the osoc team. **When the first pitcher is pitching, the second pitcher goes to the waiting** room. Keep an eye on the sequence, don't miss a beat! [Hackathon pitches: up next](hackathon-pitches.md#up-next).

### 4. You will be introduced to the Pitch arena \(magically\)

**🔇When you are in there, please mute the osoc pitch stream \(YouTube\) so we do not create a feedback loop!**

### 4. Turn on your camera

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a mac, make sure Discord has permission to your camera and your screen in your settings! Test this in advance. Go to the channel \#practical-questions if you don't know how.
{% endhint %}

If you do not have a functional camera, don't worry, we'll figure out how to fix that later.

![Look for the camera icon to turn it on](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-06-at-10.27.16.png)

If you want to show us something, you can by showing us your screen. Pick a specific application to just show one app, and pick "screens" if you want to show multiple screens.

![Share a specific app](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-06-at-10.27.41-2-.png)

![Share your entire screen](../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-07-06-at-10.27.45-2-.png)

### 5. When you're done, disconnect and enjoy the rush 🔥

### 6. Listen to your other colleagues

See your colleagues shine on our livestream and bring your enthusiasm to the \#pitch-chat channel. No need to give feedback yet, just make sure they feel empowered to be there 🔥 It takes some guts to go first.
