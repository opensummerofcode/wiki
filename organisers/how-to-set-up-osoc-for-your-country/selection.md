# Selection

## Partners

* Plan initial meetup to define project\(s\)
  * You can use a template with pre-defined questions. [Contact us](mailto:info@osoc.be) to get your hands on it!
* Confirm projects \(optional: invoice 50%\)

## Coaches

* Have an intake with potential coaches
* Select coaches
  * Balance full and half-time
  * Balance skills \(devs, designers, comms, ...\)
  * Balance experience
    * Have first-timers participate as assistant coaches.
* Brief first-time coaches



### Availability 

Availability means being there for key moments, when the team needs a coach. Depending on the size of the team and how hard the project is, a coach can handle one or two teams.

#### Big or hard projects

* **Scope** Think a big or complicated web-application — or a medium project with a lot of students with different skills \(for example hardware mixed with software or for instance exhaustive research / creativity required\).
* **Size** Usually has a lot of students \(more than 8 team members\)
* **Coach** Needs a full-time coach, or two half-time coaches. This requires a lot of availability. A mini project on the side is possible but not required \(for instance an easy website or a very experienced team with a student-coach\).

#### Easy projects

* **Scope** Think a website, maybe with an integration with a fixed design. A project that is well-defined or easy to scope along the way.
* **Size** Minimum three students
* **Coach** There is always a coach _available_ to manage the smaller team and the client, but probably won't be occupied the entire time. It is possible that a coach \(or two half-time coaches\) is managing two small projects at the same time. The coach however, should be _available_ for both teams to coach them whenever they need it — see "[The job](../../coaches/the-coaching-job/)".

## Students

* Select students \(with coaches\) based on CV and/or motivational letter
* Call the ones you're uncertain of
