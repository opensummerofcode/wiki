# Being a partner at oSoc

## Why should I participate?

**👨🏾‍💼 Hiring  
🙇🏽‍♂️ Giving back  
🙋🏼 Networking  
👩🏻‍🔬 Experimenting**

Some partners do it to give back to the community, others do it to network, and some do it to find hiring prospects. On the one hand organisations get access to fresh ideas from young and ambitious students, on the other they have access to the expertise of many experienced coaches. It’s the perfect way to finally get started on that cool idea or project you had, and really build something.

Participating in osoc enables your organisation to bring your open innovation idea or project to life while providing the next generation of web developers, designers, communication specialists and project managers with a real challenge. In one month the students will do their utter best to develop your idea into a real innovative open product or service.
