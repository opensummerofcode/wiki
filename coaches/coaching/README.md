> Having to guide others helps me make sense of how I do things myself.

> Also, osoc takes me out of my daily work. There’s this big exiting deadline. There’s a ton of energy from all the students and coaches. And in this setting it doesn’t have to be perfect. We can fail. We can experiment and have fun. That makes it a great break from my real work. One month is a good time to make something new. Not too short, not too long.
