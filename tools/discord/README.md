# Discord

## Getting started

[Create an account](https://discord.com/register) and verify your email address. Feel free to use a Discord account you already have for personal purposes, but note that we ask to use a picture of yourself so that we can all get to know and learn to recognize each other during a remote edition.

You can download the discord desktop app at [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/). You _can_ use the browser version, but you won't be able to share your screen or enable video, or watch others do it. We strongly recommend you download the desktop app.

Discord also has an [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord/id985746746) and [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discord&hl=en).

Once you have your account and application ready - [join the \#osoc20 server](https://discord.gg/PJrDvcb).
