We may store your personal data with certain trusted third parties and in locations outside our direct control, including IT service providers such as Google Drive. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly advise you review.  
  
The protection of your privacy and personal data is of the utmost concern to us. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is completely failsafe and secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you transmit to us or store, and you do so at your own risk. We also cannot guarantee that such personal data may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If you believe your personal data has been compromised, please contact us at [info@osoc.be](mailto:info@osoc.be).
